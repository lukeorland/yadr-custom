python modules that I need in my environment:

REPL :
pip install -U bpython ipython

nosetests :
pip install -U nose mock xtraceback yanc

for https://github.com/nvie/vim-pyunit :
pip install -U vim_bridge
pip install -e "hg+https://code.google.com/p/nose-machineout/#egg=nose-machineout"

# KNOWN ISSUES
vim-pymode seems to be incompatible with yadr.

I can't get the vim-pyunit thing to work.

Homebrew-installed MacVim links against the apple python, not the homebrew python.
see: https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues/4339
Homebrew-installed vim does pick up the homebrew python and all its site-packages.

if you want to use YCM with homebrew-installed python, you have to use this:
